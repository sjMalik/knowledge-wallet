## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser—typically on servers.

### Key Points

✅ Runtime Environment: It uses the V8 JavaScript engine (the same one used in Google Chrome) to execute JavaScript code on the server.

✅ Event-driven, non-blocking I/O: Ideal for building scalable, real-time applications like chat apps, APIs, and microservices.

✅ Single-threaded but asynchronous: Uses an event loop to handle many connections efficiently.

### What it’s NOT

❌ Not a programming language — JavaScript is the language.

❌ Not a framework — Frameworks like Express.js, NestJS, or Next.js are built on top of Node.js.

### Common Use Cases

Web servers

RESTful APIs

Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, games)

Microservices

CLI tools

Node.js is suitable for a wide variety of applications, especially those that need to handle many simultaneous connections, real-time communication, or non-blocking I/O operations like file or database access.

## When Not Ideal

CPU-intensive applications (e.g., video processing, image editing, machine learning)
Node.js is single-threaded and might struggle under heavy CPU loads. In such cases, Python, Go, or Rust might be better.

## Node.js: Single-Threaded + Non-Blocking

✅ What does that mean?
Single-threaded: Node.js runs JavaScript code in one main thread (unlike languages like Java or C# that spawn many threads).

Non-blocking I/O: Instead of waiting for long operations (like reading a file or querying a database), Node.js delegates those tasks to the operating system and continues executing the next line of code. This allows it to handle many concurrent operations efficiently.

## Event Loop and Callback Queue

Node.js uses an event loop. Here’s the basic process:

You call an asynchronous function (e.g., reading a file).

Node.js tells the OS to handle it.

The OS finishes the task and pushes a callback into the event queue.

When the main thread is free, the event loop picks the callback and executes it.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

console.log('Start');

// Non-blocking: delegates file read to the OS
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File content:', data);
});

console.log('End');
```

**Output**
Start
End
File content: [file contents here]

## 🛠 How to Handle CPU-Intensive Work in Node.js?

If you must use Node.js, you can:

Use Worker Threads (worker_threads module)

Offload tasks to child processes

Use microservices in other languages (e.g., Python, Go, Rust) for CPU-heavy work

### High-Performance Video or Image Processing Apps

❌ Example:
A server that uploads, resizes, and compresses thousands of images.

A platform like YouTube that transcodes and compresses videos in real time.

### 🧠 Why Node.js is NOT suitable

These tasks are CPU-bound, meaning they use a lot of processor power.

Node.js is single-threaded, so if one thread is busy compressing a large video or image, it blocks all other incoming requests until it finishes.

This can cause:

Sluggish performance

Long response times

Denial of service to other users

✅ Better Alternatives:
C++, Go, or Rust for native-level performance

Java for better multithreading support

Offload processing to external microservices or use FFmpeg via CLI

🚫 2. Machine Learning or Data Science Pipelines
❌ Example:
Real-time fraud detection using trained ML models.

A backend system running linear algebra, matrix multiplication, or large-scale data processing.

🧠 Why Node.js is NOT suitable:
JavaScript has limited support for advanced scientific and ML libraries.

Operations like matrix multiplication are CPU-heavy and require optimized, multithreaded computation.

Node.js lacks a built-in ecosystem for numerical computing and GPU acceleration.

✅ Better Alternatives:
Python (with TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy)

Java (for large-scale analytics)

Scala (with Apache Spark for big data)

🚫 3. Complex Financial or Banking Systems
❌ Example:
High-frequency trading platforms

Real-time credit risk scoring systems

Blockchain transaction verifiers

🧠 Why Node.js is NOT suitable:
These systems need:

High precision and data integrity

Multithreading to process massive transactions simultaneously

Strict type-checking and compile-time validation

Node.js is dynamically typed, increasing the risk of bugs in critical systems.

Its single-threaded model can't take full advantage of multi-core CPUs for concurrent calculations.

✅ Better Alternatives:
Java or C# (for enterprise-grade reliability)

Go or Rust (for concurrency and speed)

C++ (for ultimate control and performance)

🚫 4. Operating System or Device Drivers
❌ Example:
Creating a new operating system shell

Writing drivers for devices (e.g., USB, audio)

🧠 Why Node.js is NOT suitable:
Node.js is a high-level runtime and cannot access low-level system APIs required for driver or OS development.

It runs on top of an operating system—it's not designed to interact directly with hardware or manage memory at the byte level.

✅ Better Alternatives:
C, C++, Rust

🚫 5. Multi-Threaded Desktop Applications
❌ Example:
A powerful video editor (like Adobe Premiere)

Large-scale IDEs (like IntelliJ or Eclipse)

🧠 Why Node.js is NOT suitable:
While you can build desktop apps with Electron (based on Node.js), Electron apps:

Use a lot of memory

Are not truly multi-threaded

Struggle with performance under heavy parallel workloads

✅ Better Alternatives:
Java (Swing/JavaFX), C# (.NET), C++ (Qt) for native desktop apps

## Is Node.js Synchronous or Asynchronous?

👉 Both — but Node.js is designed to be asynchronous and non-blocking by default, especially for I/O operations like:

Reading files

Accessing databases

Making API requests

### 🧠 How Node.js achieves asynchrony

Uses event loop + callback functions, Promises, or async/await

Does not wait for one task to finish before moving to the next

✅ Node.js Example: Synchronous vs Asynchronous
🔴 Synchronous Example (blocking):

```js
const fs = require('fs');

console.log("Start");

const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8'); // Blocks here
console.log(data); // Only runs after reading is done

console.log("End");
```

Output
Start
(File contents)
End

Asynchronous Example (non-blocking):

```js
 const fs = require('fs');

console.log("Start");

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});

console.log("End");
```

## Is JavaScript (in browsers) Synchronous or Asynchronous?

🤓 Answer:
JavaScript by design is synchronous, but it supports asynchronous behavior using:

Callbacks

Promises

async/await

Web APIs (like setTimeout, fetch, etc.)

### Asynchronous with setTimeout

```js
console.log("1");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("2");
}, 1000); // Delayed by 1 second

console.log("3");
```

Output:
1
3
2

## Difference between JavaScript, Node.js & Express.js?

| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Type             | Language        | Runtime Environment | Web Framework              |
| Runs In          | Browser         | Server (using V8)   | Server (built on Node.js)  |
| Purpose          | Frontend logic  | Run JS on server    | Build web apps/APIs easily |
| Example Use Case | Form validation | File system, APIs   | RESTful backend for an app |
| Depends on       | -               | JavaScript          | Node.js + JavaScript       |

## First: What Does "Single-Threaded" Mean?

Single-threaded means Node.js uses one main thread (one path of execution) to run your JavaScript code.

So, it can’t execute multiple JavaScript instructions at the same time like multi-threaded languages (e.g., Java, C++).

## 🤔 Then How is It Non-Blocking?

Here’s the magic:

Node.js uses an event loop and asynchronous I/O to handle tasks in the background without blocking the main thread.

### 🔄 The Event Loop Handles

File system access

Network requests (like APIs)

Timers (setTimeout)

Database queries

### When you perform an I/O task

Node.js offloads it to the background (OS thread or worker pool)

Then immediately moves on to the next line of code

When the task is done, Node.js uses callbacks/promises/async-await to handle the result later

### Behind the Scenes: How Node.js Does This

Your code is executed in the main thread

If it hits an async operation (like reading a file), Node:

Sends the task to libuv (a C++ library under Node.js)

libuv handles it using threads in a background pool

Meanwhile, the main thread keeps running

Once the task is done, it sends the result back via a callback

The event loop picks up the callback and runs it in the main thread

📊 So even though Node.js is single-threaded, it uses OS-level threads and async callbacks to remain non-blocking.

## What Is a Callback?

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, and it gets called when the task is complete.

## What Is async/await?

async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises, making asynchronous code look like synchronous code, which is easier to read and write.

```js
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data received");
        }, 1000);
    });
}

async function getData() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data); // Output after 1 second: Data received
}

getData();
```

### How it works

fetchData returns a Promise

await pauses execution until the Promise resolves

Code looks synchronous but is still asynchronous under the hood

## Why Are Node.js Microservices Lightweight?

1. Single-threaded, Event-driven Architecture
Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop instead of spawning new threads per request.

It handles many simultaneous requests efficiently without heavy thread overhead.

Less memory needed because no thread stacks need to be maintained for each request.
2. Non-blocking I/O
Node.js performs asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations (like reading files, DB queries).

It doesn’t wait idly for operations to finish but keeps handling other requests.

This reduces CPU idling and resource waste, improving throughput.
3. Minimal Runtime Footprint
The Node.js runtime itself is small compared to heavier server platforms (like JVM for Java).

No need for large virtual machines or interpreters.

It loads fast and starts quickly, which is perfect for microservices that may spin up/down dynamically.
4. Lean by Design
Microservices built in Node.js often have minimal dependencies and limited scope.

They avoid heavy frameworks or bulky libraries that consume memory.

Smaller codebase means less CPU cycles to parse/execute.
5. Lightweight Communication
Node.js microservices commonly use lightweight protocols (HTTP/REST, gRPC, message queues).

Efficient serialization (JSON, Protocol Buffers) keeps message sizes small.

Lower CPU/network load during inter-service communication.

### Low Memory Usage in Node.js Microservices

Single-threaded nature reduces context switching overhead.

Garbage collector (V8 engine) efficiently manages memory in small, focused microservices.

Memory leaks are easier to detect and isolate in smaller codebases.

### Low CPU Usage in Node.js Microservices

Non-blocking I/O frees CPU cycles for processing other requests.

Event loop only uses CPU when there is work to do.

Avoids expensive thread management or synchronization overhead found in multi-threaded platforms.

## So How Does Nodejs Handle Multiple Requests?

The key is the Event Loop + Non-blocking I/O
Step-by-step:

1. Node.js starts the server and listens for HTTP requests on the single thread.
2. When an HTTP request arrives:
If the request handler is simple, synchronous, and CPU-light, Node.js will execute it immediately.

If the request involves I/O operations (database calls, file reading, network requests), Node.js starts those operations asynchronously and immediately moves on.

3. Node.js uses non-blocking asynchronous APIs:
Instead of waiting for the I/O operation to complete, Node.js registers a callback (or Promise).

The I/O operation is performed outside the main thread by the libuv thread pool or the operating system.
4. Meanwhile, Node.js continues processing other incoming requests on the main thread.
5. When the I/O operation completes:
The callback is pushed into a queue.

The event loop continuously checks this queue.

When the main thread is free, the event loop executes the callback, finishing the processing for that request.
